## One year of Open Source, what I've learned

Just over a year ago, I joined raintank and Grafana, bright eyed and ready for a new challenge. One of the most exciting parts of this new adventure was getting to work on Open Source Software. 

I owe a lot to open source. When we were starting and running Voxel back in 1999, we never would have been a viable company if it wasn’t for projects like Apache, MySQL, CentOS, etc. We never would have had a chance.  But consuming Open Source Software is very different than contributing to it.

I saw this comic right around the time we joined and frankly, it scared me. I hadnt experienced those issues yet, but it seemed intimidating.

The past year has been great, albeit frustrating at times. I went through a learning curve while contributing to Grafana, but I think a lot of the lessons learned are universal to Open Source Software. With some reflrection, here's what I learned:


### Take a moment to look around
Like most obvious advice, this is often skipped. Torkel was the largest and primary contributor to Grafana at the time (and still is), but there was a community in place. Before jumping in, I wanted to get a sense of that. It's like walking into a new bar and trying to figure out the lay of the land. I see people get frustrated and leave projects right away because they're first remarks werent well received - despite the quality of the remark being poor. 

Read the issues. Search. Get a sense of the community. Then chime in.


### Submit bugs
Another easy one, but it needs to be said. Here at Grafana, our users are extremely helpful in submitting bugs and inconsistencies, and we love them for it. When I caught an issue at first, I would take for granted that it had already been reported or it was "not a bug wont fix". Often, that was untrue.

And when I did start submitting issues, I wanted to make sure they were good ones. I searched open and closed issues first to see if one existed already. When it did exist, I posted a remark to the existing issue. If it didnt, I created a new one, and I egotistically wanted to be sure it was a positive reflection on me. The more screenshots, the better. Browser specs? Yes please. Animated gifs? Holla.

### There are no invitiations and nobody is going to wait for you
Active projects like Grafana move fast. Master changes out from under my feet daily, which is quite different from the world I came from. At first, it was unsettling. “How this can be in master? It’s not done yet. It still needs features a and b. And c. And what about d... And e..."

It's been frustrating at times but it's also reminded me that not all ideas take weeks of ideation and subconscious thought. It takes an unreasonably tight deadline and lots of stress, like any great artist will tell you. 

When feature/idea/interface element matters, insert yourself into the issue/feature immediately, and make fast, useful contributions.  It wont be perfect, but it doesnt have to be. 


### Contribute in the way you can
Especially coming to Grafana on the front-end/UX side, my original contributions were mockups and clickable prototypes. At first, I was apprehensive that I wasnt committing code. I've since realized that a big hole can be the ideation and germination phases of a project. 

Bringing some UX best practices into Grafana, I was able to flesh out the New User Registrations process in a flow chart before a single line of code was written. It changed form a few times, and I think it saved a good chunk of actual development/refactoring in the grand scheme.

So do what you do best. Any great product or project goes well beyond coding. There is UX, there is Design, there are business goals, there are user stories, etc...

### Become an exhibitionist
This was probably the biggest transition - doing things in public is daunting. There were a few times that I felt really great about a new design/feature, but nobody else thought so. In almost every case, it was becauase I didnt have enoug or had not given enough context. In most of the cases that I thought I had a great feature but nobody else cared, it was 100% my fault. 

Crafting both a description of the problem and how the proposed feature offers a solution is huge. With these, things move faster. If you are misunderstanding, the feedback will be more appropriate, and you'll know why you were mistaken. And if you're bringing new perspective, you've effectively made your case and helped others quickly understand. 


### Thicken your skin
Not every idea is a good one, and especially when the bar is lowered to submitting mockups & screenshots, I didnt always know the effort required to implementation. When my suggestions were way out of whack with feasibility, Torkel wasnt shy about letting me know. 

Torkel has been the best open source sherpa I could have asked for. He’s solicited ideas, made sure I had ample time to contribute, and turned my clickable prototypes into real code, but there were times that he'd abruptly close an issue saying, in effect, notabugwontfix. At first, it's disconcerting, because I felt like I wasted his time. 

It is a community, but there is a project lead, and that's a good thing. Ours is Torkel. He's a benevolent dictator. Grafana is his baby, and he will protect it above all else. He is one of the few that understands every idiosyncrasy, and is keeping the product on the right track.

Chin up. If your ideas arent resonating, there is a reason. Do some research, better understand the issue and try again. 



### Keep at it

Rome wasnt built in a single code commit. I'm extremely proud of what Grafana 3.0 has become, and I do believe my many contributions over the past year have helped make better software for everyone. 

You can do the same. Pick a project you enjoy (perhaps Grafana?) and start helping. Then in a year, look back, and let me know how it went. Good luck.
